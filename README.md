# DungeonCrawl

DungeonCrawl is a terminal game where a player must survive a dungeon full of monsters and traps. The player wakes up in a room and must walk through other rooms. The game ends when the player finds the exit. In each chamber, the player must decide what to do. The result of these decisions can lead the player to treasure, traps, enemies, more rooms to explore, or the exit. The game starts with the player choosing a hero to play as.

The hero has hit points, which are reduced by taking damage from fighting enemies or falling into traps. When the character reaches zero hit points, the player loses the game. The characterâ€™s hit points can be restored by finding healing potions or resting in safe rooms. The challenge is to find the exit room before the hero reaches zero hit points
